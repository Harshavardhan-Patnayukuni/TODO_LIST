TODO LIST APP


ABOUT 
This is a simple app that takes all your todo works for the day and makes a list of it and on choosing option c it allows you to mark the work to be done 
and on choosing q option if you dont have any pending works it show you are done else it show how many works are unfinished and the program ends


HOW I MADE
I  have created a class named todoitem with has id,description,completded (bool) and respective member functions to get id ,to get description,
to get completed or not ,and also a member function called create which on calling allocates random value to the id and new_description to the 
description of the  object

in the main function 
i have taken a list of todoitem to store all the todo objects
